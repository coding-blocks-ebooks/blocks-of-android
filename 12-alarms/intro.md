Alarms in Android give you a way to perform time-based operations outside the lifetime of your application.

For example, we could use an alarm to initiate a long-running operation, such as starting a service once a day to download a weather forecast.

Alarms have these characteristics:

* They let us fire Intents at set times and/or intervals.
* We can use them in conjunction with broadcast receivers to start services and perform other operations.
* They operate outside of our application, so we can use them to trigger events or actions even when your app is not running or the device is asleep.
